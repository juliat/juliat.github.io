  <div class="project-overview">
    <p>The ChemCollective has provided free online resources for chemistry teachers and students since 2000. During my internship there in 2011, I redesigned the ChemCollective’s logo and website, reengineered the backend of the site to use an MVC web framework, and consulted on the interface for their Virtual Lab.</p>
    <p>The overarching goal for the redesign was to give the site a more modern, friendly feel, while better communicating what it offered to users: academic resources for teaching and learning chemistry.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="caption long-caption">
        <p>For the new logo, I chose the typeface Lubalin Graph because its geometric forms and slab serifs gave it a scientific and academic feel, while its rounded shapes made it friendly. Scientific, academic, friendly—all fitting adjectives for the ChemCollective.</p>
        <p>The graduated cylinder incorporated into the wordmark relates the first part of the ChemCollective’s name. The image of a graduted cylinder associates strongly with the concept of chemistry (the ‘Chem’ in ChemCollective).</p>
        <p>The ChemCollective provides resources for teachers, but it’s mission extends to enabling teachers to give feedback, share classroom experiences, discuss instruction, and author their own resources. The equilibrium symbol (⇌), and a retrosynthetic arrow (⇒) in addition to the regular reaction arrow in MarvinSketch?) communicates the ‘Collective’ in ChemCollective, indicating an exchange between the project and those it serves.</p>

      <div class="caption long-caption">
        <p>The old home page had weak visual hierarchy, felt stuffy and out of date, and did not offer convenient access to most of the content on the site.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of visitors to the homepage immediately clicked the “Find Activities” link.  However, its placement and styling do not reflect its importance.</p>

        <p>Clear hierarchy and copy better communicate what the site offers to new visitors</p>
        <p>Left navigation and quick links provide quick and prominent access to activities and resources that were previously listed only on the “Find Activities” page.</p>
        <p>Navigation for non-educational content is clearly separated.</p>

        <p>After evaluating issues with the current interface and researching competitors’ interfaces and interfaces for analogous tasks. I created this a new design for the Virtual Lab. This mockup is of the main work area. One key change here was grouping all of the information about the currently selected chemical in one place, so that it would be simpler to monitor.</p>
