  <div class="project-overview">
    <p>Lilypad is a mobile web application for iPad. Its users are teachers at a school and partial hospital in Pittsburgh. The app aids teachers in collecting information about trends in childrens’ behavior and academic performance.</p>
    <p>As a Research Assistant on the project, I have conducted weekly user tests, iteratively prototyped the application at increasing levels of fidelity, and helped to develop the actual application. </p>

      <p>The paper version of the standard celeration chart that teachers use to track student's academic performance on individual skills. It captures and visualizes data simultaneously, and can be used extremely efficiently by experts. However, the paper format limits possible uses of the data (e.g., other visualizations, comparing to historical data)</p>
