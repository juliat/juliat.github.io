  <div class="project-overview">
    <p>In the capstone course for Information Systems majors, student teams are assigned clients. My team's client was a group of professors and researchers from Carnegie Mellon's Social and Decision Science department. The project was to create a web application to present the data set they had compiled about wind farms in the United States.</p>
    <p>Our clients provided us with spreadsheets of demographic, economic, and ecological data for active wind farms and potential wind farm sites. Over the course of a semester, my team built an application that parses and presents that data in a dynamic map, configurable table, and custom visualization.</p>
    <p>By providing access to a unique dataset in a user-friendly format, our application helps wind developers select sites which are likely to be welcomed by the surrounding community. The Wind Farmer's Almanac also serves concerned citizens who want to explore data about wind farm developments.</p>

        <p>Pop-up filtering controls let users easily switch between browsing results and refining them further. The filtering controls design had to be flexible enough to work for the 60 quantitative and qualitative attributes that can be displayed in the table.</p>

When my team presented it to our client, we learned that filtering and viewing results were not as separate of tasks as we originally thought. This led us to integrate popover-filters into the results table in our final application.</p>
