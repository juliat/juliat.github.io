  <div class="project-overview">
    <p>In the capstone course for Information Systems majors, student teams are assigned clients. My team's client was a group of professors and researchers from Carnegie Mellon's Social and Decision Science department. The project was to create a web application to present the data set they had compiled about wind farms in the United States.</p>
    <p>Our clients provided us with spreadsheets of demographic, economic, and ecological data for active wind farms and potential wind farm sites. Over the course of a semester, my team built an application that parses and presents that data in a dynamic map, configurable table, and custom visualization.</p>
    <p>By providing access to a unique dataset in a user-friendly format, our application helps wind developers select sites which are likely to be welcomed by the surrounding community. The Wind Farmer's Almanac also serves concerned citizens who want to explore data about wind farm developments.</p>

    <p>The ChemCollective has provided free online resources for chemistry teachers and students since 2000. During my internship there in 2011, I redesigned the ChemCollective’s logo and website, reengineered the backend of the site to use an MVC web framework, and consulted on the interface for their Virtual Lab.</p>
    <p>The overarching goal for the redesign was to give the site a more modern, friendly feel, while better communicating what it offered to users: academic resources for teaching and learning chemistry.</p>

      <div class="caption long-caption">
        <p>For the new logo, I chose the typeface Lubalin Graph because its geometric forms and slab serifs gave it a scientific and academic feel, while its rounded shapes made it friendly. Scientific, academic, friendly—all fitting adjectives for the ChemCollective.</p>
        <p>The graduated cylinder incorporated into the wordmark relates the first part of the ChemCollective’s name. The image of a graduted cylinder associates strongly with the concept of chemistry (the ‘Chem’ in ChemCollective).</p>
        <p>The ChemCollective provides resources for teachers, but it’s mission extends to enabling teachers to give feedback, share classroom experiences, discuss instruction, and author their own resources. The equilibrium symbol (⇌), and a retrosynthetic arrow (⇒) in addition to the regular reaction arrow in MarvinSketch?) communicates the ‘Collective’ in ChemCollective, indicating an exchange between the project and those it serves.</p>

    <p>During Fall 2012, I did an independent study in typography with Professor Dan Boyarski. The course projects included creating a book covers for the "Vision+Value" series, and typesetting an essay, interview, and a few recipes.</p>
    <p>The course focused on reinforcing meaning using type by selecting typefaces that fit the content's message, setting type readably (varying size, line length, leading, etc.), and   considering the relationship between type and image.</p>

  <div class="project-overview">
    <p>In this exercise, I created a desktop interface for entering data about a person's medical history. The medical history was required to have three types of data: a health questionnaire, personal medical history, and family medical history for the patient.</p>
    <p>Given the data required for the medical history, I was free to organize the collection in any order. The two other constraints were that the interface should be modular—allowing addition or removal of data collection sections—and that the interface should support recognition of relationships between the patient's medical history and their family medical history.</p>

    <p>Lilypad is a mobile web application for iPad. Its users are teachers at a school and partial hospital in Pittsburgh. The app aids teachers in collecting information about trends in childrens’ behavior and academic performance.</p>

    <p>One of my friends involved with the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/student-life/gender/mosaic/index.html">Mosaic Gender Conference at CMU</a> asked me to design a handout with a list of hotlines and emergency services related to domestic violence and sexual assualt. My goal for the design was to make the list into a handout that would useful (in the context of an emergency) and desirable (so that people would keep it.)</p>
    <p>Though the cards were originally designed for the conference, they were so positively received that Student Health Services plans to distribute them in the on-campus clinic.</p>

        <p>The inside of the card includes information for more sensitive emergency services, which are specifically for victims of sexual assault or domestic violence. The typography is designed to be highly readable, to feel calm, and to use space effectively.</p>
        <p>Since most people wouldn't be familiar with the hotlines and services listed on the card, I wrote succinct descriptions of each one. The descriptions included information about hours, transit information, and confidentiality policies, so that a person looking at the card can quickly find the service they need, when they need it.</p>
        <p>To write the two internal headings, I researched communication with survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. Both phrases were chosen to encourage survivors to seek help.</p>
