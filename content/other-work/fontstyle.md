## The Story

I was trying to explain the 'personalities' of typefaces to a non-designer friend, and why certain fonts are more appropriate for certain situations. I ended up explaining fonts as 'clothing for text'. The explanation was effective, so I decided to create some examples of fonts' clothing equivalents. You can [see the typefaces I've created outfits for so far here](http://fontstyle.tumblr.com/).
