## The Brief

For this project, one of the organizers of the conference asked me to create a card to hand out to students (primarily women) with information about hotlines and emergency services on it. To start with, the organizer provided me with a list of hotlines related to domestic violence and sexual assualt to include on the card.

## Making the Card Useful and Desirable

After receiving the brief for the project, I started thinking about how these cards should function, what might make them useful, and what would make them something that a person would actually keep it with them (so that they'd have it when they need it.)

I came up with these additional constraints for my design:

- The card needs to be small, ideally about the size of a credit card so that people can tuck it in their wallet.
- The card should be somewhat incognito. It would be uncomfortable to have someone see a list of sexual assualt hotline numbers as soon as they open your wallet.
- The emergency services and hotlines can't just have names and numbers; people don't necessarily know which one is for what. The descriptions need to make the services seem approachable.
- There are too many emergency services to put them all in one list. They need to be sorted so that you can find the one you need.

## Final Design and Rationale

### Outside

The outside of the card is decorative and includes less sensitive emergency info.The services on the outside are the most general ones: the numbers for campus police, the shuttle, and yellow cab. 

The card is meant to get a person to a service they need as soon as possible, so I included information about hours when services were available, and transit information where appropriate.

I also designed several patterns for the outside of the card, so that people could choose one they preferred. The idea was that if a person could pick a pattern they liked, they would be more likely to keep the card.

### Inside

The inside of the card includes information for more sensitive emergency services, which are specifically for victims of sexual assault or domestic violence.

#### Structure

For each service, the name and primary contact information is most prominent in bold. Underneath each service heading, there's a short description of what it provides.

##### Headings

I researched what sort of messages would encourage a victim of sexual assualt or domestic violence to seek help, which informed the wording of the two headings on the inside of the card:

 - "If you are sexually assaulted, it is not your fault. Don't be afraid to ask for help or support."
 - "You deserve to feel safe, accepted, and valued in your relationships."

### Form

To settle on a size for the card, I printed out several test cards and tried putting them in my wallet. This also helped to figure out what size would work for the type.

The card was printed on thicker, cardstock paper so that it would not get crumpled or torn easily.

## Repurposing

Though the cards were originally designed for the conference, the organizer liked them enough that they were interested in tweaking the design so that the cards could be distributed at other campus events. (The above designs are the tweaked ones, with the Mosaic Conference branding removed.)
