## Overview

I created the website for [ScottyLabs](http://www.scottylabs.org), a technical resource group for students that promotes innovation in practical ways. The site had two intended audiences: students interested in participating in ScottyLabs or attending our events, and potential partners or sponsors.

The site's design was meant to communicate that ScottyLabs is inspiring, technical, innovative, fresh, and rebellious. The design shown here is the result of four design iterations.

## Initial Design

This was the first version of the ScottyLabs website. When I created this, I worked mainly off of assumptions about what the site's content and goals were. The assumptions were not founded off nothing, since I was one of the charter members of the organization, but the lack of explicit content and goals meant that the designs had some key weaknesses.

We discarded this design because it was too professional and rigid. It didn't communicate the friendliness and out-of-the-box character of the organization. In addition, the site content was informational and basic. Later, we clarified that the site should have richer information. For example, we later added prominent information about upcoming events to our homepage.

## Defining Goals, Audience, and Content

The first design made it clear that we needed to explicitly design the goals, audience, and content. Based on discussion with ScottyLabs members and exec board, I outlined clearer goals for further design iterations.

From those initial notes, I created outlines of the audience, content, and impression-goals for the site.

### Audience

- Students interested in participating in ScottyLabs events or joining the organization.
- Potential partners or sponsors for our events.

### Content

Since ScottyLabs generally creates event and project specific sites, the ScottyLabs site had few pages:

- Home: featured projects and upcoming events.
- Projects: descriptions for each of our projects.
- About: mission, history, and members of the organization.
- Partners: list of and information about our partners and sponsors.

### Impression Goals

- inspiring
- technical
- innovative
- fresh
- rebellious

## Graphic Design

After deciding on the content, audience, goals for the site, the next step was to generate ideas on how to translate the impressions we wanted to give into visuals. To do so, I associated design elements with each impression-goal adjective. I also created a collage to develop the graphic design direction for the site.

## Intermediate Drafts

After generating design elements based on the site's goals, I developed various alternates to refine the design.

The above series was the first round of intermediate designs. Of the three, the one that most influenced the further designs was the first (on the left). It's geometric forms and variety of colors influenced the later and final designs.

Based on the second round of designs, I decided to go further with the color scheme from the third design (red, orange, light blue, and dark blue), and to abandon the concept of a geometric background pattern (which was too distracting and did not feel 'fresh').

## Final Design

### Typography

The final site used two web fonts: [Bitter](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Bitter) and [PT Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/PT+Sans). The slab serif and sans-serif combo gave the site a friendly and modern feel.

### Colors, Shapes, and Textures

The bright, complementary color palette of orange, red, light blue, and dark blue was fresh, innovative, inspiring, and rebellious. The rectuangular, geometric shapes recall pixels and make the site more technical feeling.

The final design uses a subtle, dotted background pattern to add texture. The background makes the site feel technical. However, the use of dots rather than a grid or geometric pattern kept the site feeling fresh and inspiring.

## Implementation

Since the site was so small, I implemented it using vanilla HTML, CSS, and javascript. I used CSS media queries to create a responsive design that functions across practically all screen sizes.
