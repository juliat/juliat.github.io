## Concept

Technology is often criticized for making people less engaged with one another. And to some degree that accusation is accurate; I've been out to dinner with people constantly checking their phones or text messages. Still, technology also gives people the power to connect with one another, and in my own life, I know many of my in-person interactions are enabled or influenced by ones that happen online beforehand. So, for a project to document one week of my life, I wanted to visualize the flow of my interactions with my friends across media: texts, emails, Facebook messages, and in-person encounters.

### Sketches

## Technical Side

In two weeks, I developed a very basic application to log my offline interactions, and integrated a few APIs with the Raphael.js library to create a vector-based visualization, which I then tweaked in Adobe Illustrator.
