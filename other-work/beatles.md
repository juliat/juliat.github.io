## Posters

This poster series relates three Beatles’ songs: Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, Hey Jude, and Here Comes the Sun. The theme of hope ties together the three songs, and the posters reflect the songs’ hopeful mood.

## Design Process

For this piece, I wrote a design brief, conducted photo research, created a mood board, explored layout concepts, and interated through many versions of the design.
