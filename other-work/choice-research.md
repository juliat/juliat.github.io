## Abstract

Past research and folk wisdom endorse the idea that provision of choice increases motivation and performance. We tested whether the provision of choice between two simple online tasks increased motivation or performance for 49 participants randomly assigned to either a choice or no choice condition. In both cases, we retained the null hypothesis: we did not find significant effects of choice on either motivation or performance for our experimental tasks. We also consider directions for future research on attributes of choices that would influence outcomes for motivation and performance.
