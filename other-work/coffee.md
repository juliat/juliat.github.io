## Project Overview

For this project, I worked with Andrew Mittereder and Ariel Liu, two other (awesome) undergraduate Human-Computer Interaction students. Our project was to use ubiquitous computing to enhance the coffee shop experience.

Coffee shops are an interesting space because are neither home nor work. They function as a place to do work, to socialize, to meet, and as a source of caffeine, of course.

Our challenge, given our goal and the context, was to enhance shop visitors' experience without changing the ambiance.

## Research

To begin to address the challenge, we conducted research at local coffee shops. Talking to baristas and customers, we learned about why customers frequent some coffee shops rather than others, how the physical environment could affect the clientele, and about people's work habits at coffee shops.

### Findings: Types of People at Coffee Shops

One of the most important things that came out of our research were the different "user types". People we called "Grab and Gos" simply come, order, take their coffee and leave. The "Work Alones" come to the shop to work alone for several hours. They often bring laptops, wear headphones, and spread papers out over whatever table they sit at.  "Friends" come to the shop to catch up, usually for around an hour. Some come to have a work meeting. They are usually there for under an hour, and have serious discussion without lingering. Last, there are people who come to have coffee alone. They usually come, sit and enjoy their coffee in the shop, then leave once they are done. These user types helped us focus our design concepts as we progressed.

### Findings: Principles for Not Annoying People

From our research, we also came up with a set of principles to guide our concept development. These are two of the principles that ended up influencing the our final concepts the most. First, we wanted to respect what each user came there to do. For instance, we wanted to avoid creating a system where someone who came to work would be distracted. Our second principle was to be careful about adding screens (especially on the walls), as they might change the ambiance of the shop.

## Concept Development

### Themes

![](/assets/images/coffee/casual-coffee-final-presentation5.jpg)

Based on our initial research, we had four themes around which we developed more detailed concepts. We thought about augmenting the menu with more information to encourage people to explore more drinks, and make people who are less knowledgeable feel like they fit in at shops that serve connoisseurs. Another theme was streamlining coffee ordering and drink customization, allowing people to modify their drinks without having to rattle off a long order or wait while others did so.  Two other concept-themes were allowing people to project their music into the shop, and to make the tables act as computing devices.

### Getting Feedback on Ideas

![](/assets/images/coffee/casual-coffee-final-presentation6.jpg)

We developed more specific ideas around those concepts, and speed-dated them with about 10 people.

People really liked the augmented menu concepts and the idea of customizing their drinks. People were very confused by the concepts around projecting and sharing music, and didn't find them to be desirable solutions. And, though people we talked to during our initial research liked the idea of tabletop computing, when we showed our speed-dating users storyboards with those sorts of tables, we got lukewarm reactions. People thought that the tables would be unnecessary, given the ubiquity of laptops and smartphones. People were also worried that having computing-enabled tables would distract people from social interaction.

Based on our speed-dating feedback, we decided to move forward with our stronger two concepts, the augmented menus and streamlined ordering and customization of drinks.

## Chosen Concept

Our solution had two main, largely separate components. The components both enhance the coffee shop experience, but they were largely separate because they served two different user groups. The first part of the solution, on the go ordering, was targeted at grab-and-go coffee shop users, whereas the second part of the solution, the cup-shelf-menu, was aimed at people who come to a coffee shop to stay and socialize, work, or relax.

### On-the-Go Ordering Via Text

![](/assets/images/coffee/casual-coffee-final-presentation8.jpg)

For the first part of the system, a customer with a cell phone could send messages to and receive messages from their regular coffee shop. The system would use machine learning to understand regulars' coffee buying habits, and send them a text message with the option to order ahead in the morning if they are running late. A customer could also proactively text their coffee shop and ask to have their order prepared ahead of time. Once a customer confirms a purchase via text, they receive a receipt and a notification once the coffee is ready. Customers would pick up their drink at the shop from a barista by telling the barista their name. (On the go orders would have names attached.)

On the go ordering really suits the needs of people who want to grab their coffee and go. It enhances their coffee shop experience in two key ways. First, it eliminates unpleasant, and possibly stressful waiting in line. Second, it keeps a positive interaction with the barista, since they still greet you and give you your drink (we found that barista interaction was important in our research). In addition, the on-the-go ordering system helps shops keep the business of people who don't have time to stand in line.

When we speed-dated this advance ordering, it was the most popular concept overall. People could see themselves using it, and their few concerns with it were minor and mostly logistical--like making sure that people would know where and when to pick up their coffee.

### Custom Cups Menu

![](/assets/images/coffee/casual-coffee-final-presentation11.jpg)

Our second concept aimed to enhance the experience of people who come to a coffee shop to stay. Here's how it works: The menu is made up of shelves with computing-enabled cups on them. Each shelf represents a different drink, and a panel on the edge of the shelf shows the drink’s name, how many people have “liked” it, and  the flavors of that drink. When a person picks up a cup, they see a display of what the ingredients are and can interact with each ingredient section to customize the drink and tweak its ingredients. If they have ordered and customized this drink before, then the cup automatically displays their usual tweaks. A customer gives the cup to the barista to order and once they pass the cup over, they can automatically pay for that drink.

Our Custom Cups suit the needs of many of the coffee shop user-types we identified during our research. It is useful for people who come to work alone, friends who come to socialize, and people who come to drink coffee alone. It enhances their experience by helping them to understand different drinks and try new things, shortens the time it takes to make an order, can add personality to the shop, and is non-obtrusive; because the interface to customize the coffee is part of the cups, the rest of the coffee shop environment is minimally modified and not overly-technological.

People liked the ability to customize their drink and liked that the cup itself was the interface to do so. Users also suggested having the cups default to match past preferences, an idea we incorporated into our final design.

## Summary

Our original goal was to enhance the coffee shop experience using ubiquitous computing. Our two designs, on-the-go-ordering and custom cups, enhance individuals' experience. Ordering is less stressful for people who are getting their coffee in a hurry, and for people who come to stay, the custom cups menu allows for more exploration, educates people about what's available, provides entertainment while standing in line, makes ordering faster, and allows people to voice their opinions about different options and see others' opinions as well.

### More Ideas

In the future, we would test this system using lower fidelity prototypes to further validate and refine our concepts. We're pretty confident that they'd work, but to test that out, we could test our custom cups menu using paper cups and markers or construction paper. We could also test our on-the-go-order texting interface by having a human, rather than a machine, send the texts. Then, we would pilot the actual system on a small scale.
Beyond that, we could commercialize each design. The texting on-the-go ordering system might be available as a subscription service for coffee shops. Similarly, we could sell our custom cups menu as an out of the box solution for shops.
