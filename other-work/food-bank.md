## Context

Design for America is a network of student-leddesign studios at universities across the U.S. As part of a studio, students from across disciplines look for opportunities to address local issues using human-centered design. I am a co-founder of the DFA studio at Carnegie Mellon. For our studio's first project, we researched issues around food security, visiting local food pantries and food banks. 

### The Problem

Our final design addresses a basic problem: many stakeholders in the food bank system don't understand the structure of the system as a whole. For instance, people who hold food drives often don't realize that food pantries (e.g., a church where food is distributed) are part of a larger network based around regional warehouses (food banks.) The lack of understanding means that stakeholers in the system have less power to affect change in it, and it also reduces outsiders' ability to contribute to the system's efforts to improve food security.
