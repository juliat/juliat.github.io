## Abstract

Movies and television often portray friends with benefits relationships (FWBRs) developing into romantic relationships. However, real-life FWBRs do not often have such happy endings. We collected data from a survey of a large sample of college students (n = 557) regarding opinions and experiences of both traditional romantic relationships and FWBRs to address two research questions. What are the outcomes of FWBRs and how do individuals react emotionally to FWBRs after they end? Our results indicated that most FWBRs were likely to damage the friendship, rather than develop into romance. Reports of feelings about FWBRs in retrospect suggested that emotional reactions to FWBRs are negative in comparison to emotional reactions to traditional relationships.
