title: Sunrise Alarm Clock

description: As part of the annual Build18 ECE Hackathon at CMU, two friends and I constructed an alarm clock which you could control using a web interface, and which simulated (more or less) a sunrise in order to wake you up.

## My Role

For this project, I helped some with the hardware, but primarily worked on getting the [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com/) we were using to communicate with the Arduino in the alarm clock. 

I also built a very basic web page where a person could set their wake up time (which would then send that information to the Electric Imp API, where a script on the Electric Imp servers would process it and send it to the Imp shield on our Ardino.)
