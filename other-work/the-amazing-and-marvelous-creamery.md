## Complete Designs

You can see [the finished application live on heroku](http://aandmcreamery.herokuapp.com/). To see the application as an administrator, login as **alex@example.com**. To see the application as a store manager, login as **rachel@example.com**. To see the application as an employee, login as **dusty@example.com**. The password for all users is **creamery**.

Below are a few selected screenshots of the application:
