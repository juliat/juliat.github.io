## Concept

Technology is often criticized for making people less engaged with one another. And to some degree that accusation is accurate; I've been out to dinner with people constantly checking their phones or text messages. Still, technology also gives people the power to connect with one another, and in my own life, I know many of my in-person interactions are enabled or influenced by ones that happen online beforehand. So, for a project to document one week of my life, I wanted to visualize the flow of my interactions with my friends across media: texts, emails, Facebook messages, and in-person encounters.

### Sketches

After some initial sketches, I focused on two main visual concepts. The first is the one shown in the final above: a plot of communications over time sorted by type. This concept communicates more about how messages sent in one media overlap with or might lead to messages in another.

The second concept focuses on how communications vary for individual relationships, and similarities and differences between how I communicate with different individuals. It shows me and a friend as two nodes, with lines between the two nodes showing each communication (color-coded.)

## Technical Side

In two weeks, I developed a very basic application to log my offline interactions, and integrated a few APIs with the Raphael.js library to create a vector-based visualization, which I then tweaked in Adobe Illustrator.
