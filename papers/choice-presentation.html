<h1>
    Hypothesis
</h1>
<p>
    If individuals are offered a simple choice about the order in which they complete two tasks, then they will be more motivated to complete the tasks and
    perform better overall.
</p>
<h1>
    Method
</h1>
<p>
    A roughly 50 person convenience sample will complete two simple sorting tasks, and a follow-up survey online. Half of the participants were randomly
    assigned to a choice condition in which they chose which task to complete first. The control group (no-choice condition) was randomly assigned to complete
    the two tasks in a random order. Each participant completed a name-sorting and a number-sorting task. We timed each task and asked participants to complete
    a brief survey about their motivation after both tasks.

<p>
    Overall, participants in the choice condition had higher average motivation for each task and on average. However, the differences in motivation between
    the choice and no-choice group were not statistically significant.

</p>
<p>
    Participants in the experimental choice condition overall performed worse than participants in the no-choice condition. They spent more time completing
    each task and more time total. However, the differences in performance between the two groups were not statistically significant.
